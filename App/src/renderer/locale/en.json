        "a1": "What do you want most of all?  This question defines the goals that each of us sets throughout their life, especially on New Year's Eve, at the beginning of the month and every Monday.  Does anyone know how fast we delay the achievement of our goals for later?  Records are lost, process control is not maintained, do-to lists remain incomplete?  We are familiar with it !  That’s why we introduce the service TaskView  - a service designed for achieving goals.  Let's dwell on its main features.",
        "a2": "The first right step towards achieving the goal is setting it.  Create one, two, ten goals.  All of them will be grouped into a single list, and opposite each goal, the current progress towards its achievement will be always  displayed.  How is it calculated?  More about it below.",
        "a3": "The main obstacle towards achieving any goal is its scale.  Dozens, hundreds of tasks scare people and make them procrastinate.  So why should we keep putting up roadblocks and take on the whole goal at once?  Let's group the tasks into several lists together according to any sign - by stages, by the similarity of tasks, logically, as you like.  Each completed task gives a plus to your progress.",
        "a4": "It's simple: set a task, set a time, take a note.  Upon completion, all tasks appear in the list of completed tasks.  Added the task to the wrong list?  Move it to the right one.  You want to transfer several at once?  TaskView will transfer for you.",
        "a5": "To achieve the goal, just task lists will not be enough, so TaskView has the ability to make notes for each goal.  Build your knowledge database immediately in the service, and let nothing distract you from achieving your goals.  Convenient text editor allows you to  format text easily and take notes to your liking.",
        "a6": "Do you know that feeling  when a brilliant idea, urgent task or important plans appeared, but now there is no time to be distracted for more than a few seconds and put them down?  As a result, we forget, miss deadlines, being late for the meeting (underline what is necessary).  At TaskView, we will not skip it.  Add tasks during the day to the express list on the main page of the application, and in the evening just assign tasks to goals and plan the time to achieve them.",
        "a7": "In TaskView, starting from third version , two ways of storing data will be available: in the cloud for using the service on all your devices and locally for storing important goals on only one device.  Until third version , all data is stored locally.",
        "a8": "TaskView is available in two languages - English and Russian.  For the convenience of working with the service, there are two appearances  - light and dark.  Which side are you on?",
